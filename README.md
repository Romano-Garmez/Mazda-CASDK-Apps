# Mazda CASDK Apps
 
A handful of apps for the 2014-2019 Mazda Connect system. Requires installing CASDK via Mazda AIO Tweaks

Includes:
- cannonball/lap timer app with stopwatch avg speed, current speed, rpm, coolant temp, intake temp, etc.
- joke fuel economy app that measures in obscure units
- acceleration timer (functions but due to slow update rate of vehicle speed it's not very helpful)
- web browser embed app (edit the link in the js file)
- joke app to point to nearest McDonalds and Starbucks ~~(WIP)~~
- revised and fixed CASDK apps I found online:
  - multidash now loads
  - 2048 works, but is missing animations
  - snake, tetris, breakout have speed restriction disabled
- ~~More to be included later~~

## Unfortunately this will likely be the end of me working on this project. Another driver wrecked my car, and insurance deemed it totalled. I'd be happy to answer any questions about hacking the Mazda Connect system or writing CASDK apps.

#### Lap timer and extra gauges! May need some fine tuning for your specific vehicle

# Fuel Consumption

#### Fuel consumption in a variety of strange measurements, including realtime gas gauge bar at the bottom of the screen

# Starbucks per McDonalds joke app

#### Currently untested

# 0-60 Timer

#### Non-functional due to CASDK's 1 second polling rate for all vehicle data
