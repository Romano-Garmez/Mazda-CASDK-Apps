# Mazda CASDK Apps
 
A handful of apps for the 2014-2019 Mazda Connect system. Requires installing CASDK via Mazda AIO Tweaks

Includes:
- joke app to point to nearest McDonalds and Starbucks
- joke fuel economy app that measures in obscure units
- cannonball/lap timer app with avg speed, avg mpg, rpm, current speed, etc. (WIP)
- acceleration timer (WIP)
- doom on the Mazda infotainment (WIP)
- web browser embed app (edit the link in the js file)
- revised and fixed CASDK apps I found online:
  - multidash now loads
  - 2048 loads in simulator, not in car yet (WIP)
- More to be included later
